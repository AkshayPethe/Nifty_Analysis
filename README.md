# Nifty 50 Index Analysis and Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains two main projects: **Nifty 50 Index Analysis** and **Prediction of Nifty Index**. These projects aim to analyze the historical trends and patterns in the Nifty 50 stock index and predict its future movements using various techniques and models.

## Nifty 50 Index Analysis

### Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the historical price and volume data of the Nifty 50 index.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks containing the analysis process, visualization, and technical indicator calculations.
- `README.md`: Detailed documentation for the Nifty 50 Index Analysis.

### Analysis

The analysis is divided into several key sections:

1. **Data Collection:** Gathering historical price and volume data of the Nifty 50 index.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and formatting the data, handling missing values and outliers.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing the price and volume trends, identifying patterns, and correlations.
4. **Technical Indicators:** Calculating technical indicators such as Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Bollinger Bands, 7-day Moving Average (7MA), 21-day Moving Average (21MA), Momentum, and Signal indicators.
5. **Short-Term Market Prediction:** Exploring how these indicators can be used together to predict short-term market movements.
6. **Visualization:** Creating informative charts and plots to showcase the insights gained from the analysis.

## Prediction of Nifty Index

### Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the historical data used for prediction.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of ARCH, GARCH, and LSTM models for prediction.

### Models

In the **Prediction of Nifty Index** project, we focus on predicting the future volatility of the Nifty 50 index using different models:

- **ARCH and GARCH Models:** Implementing ARCH and GARCH models to capture the conditional volatility of the index.
- **LSTM Model:** Developing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for predicting short-term index movements.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Navigate to the respective project directories (`Nifty 50 Index Analysis` or `Prediction of Nifty Index`) and explore the notebooks.
